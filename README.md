## Final Project in 02808-Personal Data Interaction for Mobile and Wearables

This app is the app we used for the final project in the course 02808-Personal Data Interaction for Mobile and Wearables. It's a prototype where you can add your physical training exercises, rate the exercises and log how much water you drink to see if there is any correlation between your rating of the exercise and how much water you drink.

The app is made by Matz-Leander Solheim Wiik and Fei Xie.
